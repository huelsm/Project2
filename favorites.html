<p>Out of all the Star Wars movies, I always enjoyed Empire Strikes back the most. </p>

<p>My mom always watched and quoted Forrest Gump as I grew up and I love the movie everytime I watch it.</p>
<img src="spr.jpg" alt="Saving Private Ryan">
<p>Saving Private Ryan is not the best movie to watch as a kid, but I am glad I saw it when it I did. It is a fantastic movie.</p>
